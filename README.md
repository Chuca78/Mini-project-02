# <Mini-Project-02-Webpage>

## Description

This is the mini project 02 for the UT Austin coding boot camp. For this project I was not given any starter code, instead I created all code from scratch. This project will build the framework for my personal portfolio page. My goal was to showcase my newly learned skills including flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. The deployed projects are notional and the stories and links serve as placeholders for my future work as a programmer.
