                <p>This project creates a weather application that shows the users current and forecast 
                    weather using geo-location, it default to Charlotte, NC if it is unable to retrieve user's location. 
                    The application uses an event listener and input fields to update the desired weather location. 
                    Using the geo-location, default location, or input location the weather application interfaces with 
                    openweather map's API to retrieve weather conditions for the user. This website is designed to show 
                    my proficiency in building code from scratch to satisfy the user story and acceptance criteria.

                <p> This type of project is called an "on the job ticket" where I was given existing code and the 
                    challenge was to write js to make the website work. The challenge for this project was to create a 
                    daily schedule that accepts text input form the user. The first thing I did was create a jquery 
                    script to display the current date in the header/ Next I created the text block which houses the 
                    time blocks, text areas, and save button. I also tied a function to compare the present hour to 
                    schedule hour that displays different colors for past, present, and future times. Lastly, the save 
                    buttons are tied to local storage to save the text input form the user.

                <p>This project creates a code quiz with a timer and several event listeners. 
                    The html, JavaScript, and CSS files work together to ensure seamless timers 
                    across all questions, time out functions, and timer penalties for incorrect answers.
                    At the end of the quiz the user is invited to enter their initials to a high score 
                    board that utilizes local storage to maintain the scores and user initials.

                <p>This project is an "on the job ticket". I was given the index.html, style.css, and a basic framework 
                    in the script.js for a website that only showed text and styling, with no functionality.  
                    The challenge for this project was to create a random password generator that accepts length 
                    and character requirements from the user. First I created a prompt for the length of password 
                    (within 8 and 128 characters) and used a window alert to tell the user if the length was accepted. 
                    Next I created user prompts for the four types of characters that the password could include. 
                    Lastly I created the random password generator that ensures that the user gets at least one of each 
                    type of character selected.

                <p>I created an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. 
                    This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file. 
                    The application's front end was already created and my ticket was to build the back end, connect the two, 
                    and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.

                    using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package 
                    for authentication.
